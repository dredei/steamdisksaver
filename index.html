			<h4>Recover disk space</h4>
			<p>Most games ship with files that aren't accessed by the game at all. These remain on your disk, wasting space, never to be used. Steam Disk Space lets you delete these files, recovering disk space.
		</div>
		<div class=span4>
			<h4>Improve game startup time</h4>
			<p>Some games show videos on startup, like intro movies or developer, publisher and hardware logos. Sometimes, these videos aren't even skippable. Steam Disk Saver allows you to delete these videos, making the game start up faster.
		</div>
		<div class=span4>
			<h4>Safe to use</h4>
			<p>By design, Steam Disk Saver can only delete files within a game's directory. It will never delete anything else. All supported games have been tested to work properly after files have been deleted.
			<p>If needed, Steam Disk Saver allows you to tell Steam to restore deleted files.
		</div>

			<h4>Skip DirectX installs</h4>
			<p>Never wait for Steam to install DirectX yet again. Steam Disk Saver allows you to delete redistributables before running a game for the first time.
			<p>If it turns out that the game doesn't run because of a missing installation, you can restore deleted files. Steam will install the redistributables next time you start the game.
		</div>
		<div class=span4>
			<h4>Automatic definition update</h4>
			<p>Steam Disk Saver always obtains the latest definition when started. This way, you don't have to download Steam Disk Saver again when new definitions for games are released.
